This chapter takes a rigorous, yet very clear, ‘first principles’ approach, expressing the total Gibbs free energy of a reaction mixture at any time as the sum of the instantaneous Gibbs free energies of each component, as expressed in terms of the extent-of-reaction. The equilibrium reaction mixture is then defined as the point at which the total system Gibbs free energy is a minimum, from which concepts such as the equilibrium constant emerge. The chapter also explores the temperature dependence of equilibrium, this being one example of Le Chatelier’s principle. Finally, the chapter links thermodynamics to chemical kinetics by showing how the equilibrium constant is the ratio of the forward and backward rate constants. We also introduce the Arrhenius equation, closing with a discussion of the overall effect of temperature on chemical equilibrium.</p>"

In particular it engages with the work of Richard Price. It reinterprets the taboo from the perspective of Quentin Skinner and his concept of the ‘innovating ideologist.’ Instead of viewing the taboo as a social construction, this analysis argues that actors can exert significant agency over the taboo and the way in which it is employed in political discourse.</p>"

The next seven chapters, starting with this one, give the groundwork on which the main conclusions are based. The intention is to assemble the needed ideas, taking advantage of the fact that an extensive literature exists in which the ideas are established, discussed, restricted, etc. What follows is thus an extract of selected essentials from other documents, rather than being a free-standing and self-contained development of the ideas. The reader is asked to relate the ideas as summarized here to the longer discussions in which they appear elsewhere. The total energy in a portion of material can be split in either of two ways: . . . Total energy = internal energy + external energy, or . . . . . . Total energy = free energy + bound energy . . . In symbols, . . . U + PV = total = G + TS . . . where U = internal energy of the portion; G = free energy of the portion, specifically the Gibbs free energy or enthalpy; P = pressure; V = volume of the portion; T = temperature; S = entropy of the portion. All the terms except the free energy, G, have independent definitions, so the equations just given define that quantity: . . . G = U + PV – TS (2.1) . . . The equation relates to whatever portion of material one has in view. We now suppose that the material has n components and that, in the portion considered, the masses of each are m1, m2, . . . , mn. Then we imagine increasing m1 by a small amount δm1 while keeping P, T, and m2, m3, . . , ,mn constant. Let the consequent change in G be δG: then the limit of the ratio δG/δm1 as δm1 → 0 is the quantity of interest, henceforth written μ1; it is the chemical potential of component 1 in the material at its current pressure, temperature, and composition.</p>"

There, first and second derivatives of normal stress with respect to orientation were used; we now examine the idea that the chemical potential of a component at a point can be a multivalued direction-dependent scalar like the normal-stress magnitude, and that it too can have a gradient with respect to orientation. The essence of a nonhydrostatic stress is that different planes through a point are subject to different normal compressive stresses: σn varies with the orientation of the plane considered. Let us focus on a plane i across which the normal compressive stress is σi: then we put forward the assertion that an equilibrium state that can be associated with plane i is a hydrostatic state whose pressure has the same magnitude as σi. For illustration, see Figure 9.1. (For the present, we take a cautious stance: each hydrostatic state in the figure is certainly an equilibrium state, and each is certainly associated with a plane, but is it the associated equilibrium state that properly belongs with that plane according to the precepts of, for example, de Groot (1951, p. 11)? For now, we make no attempt to prove that it is so: we simply use the assertion and explore its consequences. Fortunately its consequences include large amounts of classical mechanics so that it counts as a ""successful assertion"" on those grounds, but at least for now it lacks any underpinnings.) An immediate consequence of the assertion illustrated in Figure 9.1 is the relation in Figure 9.2.</p>"
